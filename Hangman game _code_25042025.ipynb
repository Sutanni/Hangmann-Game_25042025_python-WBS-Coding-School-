Copy your solution from the last step.<br><br>\n","2. Create a for loop inside the while loop (after the user input) that will iterate over all the letters in `answer_word`.<br><br>\n","3. Use an if statement inside this loop to check each letter in `answer_word` against the `picked_letter` and see if they match. (We will complete this if statement in step 3.6, for now it will show a red underline as you cannot have an empty if statement).<br><br>\n","4. Inside the while loop, but _before_ the for loop, define a variable called `index_count`. We will use this to keep track of which underscore corresponds to the letter being compared inside the for loop. Set it to 0 to start (remember that the first character in a string or item in a list is indexed with the number 0, not 1). <br><br>\n","5. Inside the for loop, after the incomplete if statement, increment the `index_count` by 2 each time it loops. Doing this will allow us to keep track of the underscore corresponding to the letter we are looking at. (For instance, on the third iteration of the for loop we will be looking at the third letter in `answer_word` and `index_count` will store the number 4 (0+2+2). 4 is the index for the third underscore in `hidden_word`)<br><br>\n","5. Now we want to *update* `hidden_word` so that, when the letter guessed is in the `answer_word`, we replace the corresponding underscores in hidden word with the correctly guessed letter (_ _ _ _ -> _ _ E _). Inside the for loop's if statement, whenever we find letters that match, use the `index_count` to slice and then concatonate the `hidden_word` such that it now consist of: the first part of the `hidden_word` + the correctly `picked_letter` + the remaining characters of the `hidden_word` (except the underscore that is being replaced). This should replace an underscore in `hidden_word` with the correct letter wherever the `picked_letter` matches up with a character in `answer_word`. <br><br>\n","7. Add another condition to the while loop that will check if the number of underscores `_` inside the `hidden_word` is different than 0. This will allow us to end the loop when the players wins (right now it only ends when they lose).<br><br>\n","8.
